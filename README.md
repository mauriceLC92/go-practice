# go-practice

`go-practice` is a repository to store all Go applications and code that I have created for the purpose of getting more familiar with the language.

I have tried to follow TDD as much possible and kept with the `red-green-refactor` methodolody while creating each application. Given Go's excellent support for testing I have tried to write test's for different behaviours - "_one behaviour, one test_"
